### Hello! 👋😄

My name is Damian. I'm a Full Stack Engineer based in Kraków, Poland. I specialize in apps using Ruby, Python & React, usually leveraging AWS for infrastructure 🖥️

I love teaching people! 👨‍🏫 Here you can find all code snippets from my presentations in conferences and blogposts. I hope this collection will be growing consistently over time 😄

You can find me in several places on the Internet - come and take a look if you want to find something nice to read:
